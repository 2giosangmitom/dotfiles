#### Configuration Breakdown:

- **Home Manager**:

  - User-specific packages and configurations reside within the `./home` directory. This includes Hyprland, CLI tools configuration files for a seamless setup.
  - `./home/default.nix`: This file acts as the entry point for your home manager configuration.
